Installation -

    Install clint:

        $ pip install clint
        or
        $ easy_install clint

        For more information visit: https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint

    In the terminal, navigate to the directory where 'todo' resides.

    Make 'todo' executable by executing, in the terminal:

        $ chmod +x todo

    You can now execute the following, when your current working directory
    is the same as 'todo':

        $ python todo help

    If you want to be able to execute the program from anywhere (you should
    want this), add the following line to your .profile, .bash_rc or .zshrc
    file (depending on your operating system and shell):

    alias todo='/the/path/to/your/todo/file/todo'

    Make sure to reopen your terminal for the alias to take affect.
